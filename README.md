# Nations DM/GM Sheet

## What is it?

This project is a collection of tools for playing/keeping track of a game I concieved where players work with a host (or DM/GM if you prefer) to tell a history of a world they create and shape together.
The project is planned to include a variety of tools like a dice roller for resolving situations and deciding outcomes, a Date tracker, Statistics calculators that track things like populations, as well as "character sheets" for the nations that make up the world. The idea is also to be able to add new stats and items to each player as the game develops as well, and have any trackers update to reflect it.
